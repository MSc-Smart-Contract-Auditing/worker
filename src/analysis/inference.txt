Below are one or more Solidity codeblocks. The codeblocks might contain vulnerable code.
If there is a vulnerability please provide a description of the vulnearblity in terms of the code that is responsible for it.
Describe how an attacker would be able to take advantage of the vulnerability so the explanation is even more clear.

If there is no vulnerability output "There is no vulnearbility".
Do not output any ways to mitigate or fix the vulnerability, only the vulnerability itself.

Think step by step about the code and the possible vulnerabilities.
