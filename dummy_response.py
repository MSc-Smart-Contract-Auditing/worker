audit = """The `increaseRedemptionFee` function in the `DepositRedemption` contract allows signers to approve a signable bitcoin transaction with a higher fee, in the event that the network is congested and miners are not approving the lower-fee transaction. This function can be called every 4 hours, and each increase must increment the fee by exactly the initial proposed fee. However, there is no limit to the number of times `increaseRedemptionFee` can be called, which can lead to an unbounded increase in the transaction fee.

For instance, over a 20-hour period, `increaseRedemptionFee` could be called 5 times, increasing the fee to `initialRedemptionFee * 5`. Similarly, over a 24-hour period, `increaseRedemptionFee` could be called 6 times, increasing the fee to `initialRedemptionFee * 6`. This could potentially lead to a situation where the transaction fee becomes excessively high, making it difficult or impossible to provide a redemption proof.

```
function increaseRedemptionFee() public {
    require(block.timestamp - lastRedemptionIncrease > 4 hours, "increaseRedemptionFee: cannot increase fee more than once every 4 hours");
    lastRedemptionIncrease = block.timestamp;
    redemptionFee += initialRedemptionFee;
}
```"""
